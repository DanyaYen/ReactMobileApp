# ReactMobileApp

## Description

This project is a mobile calculator app with notes, created using React Native. It is my first attempt at mobile development.

## Technologies

- **React Native** - A library for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React.
- **TypeScript** - A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.

## Installation

To install and run this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DanyaYen/ReactMobileApp.git
    cd ReactMobileApp
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    Ensure you have Node.js and a package manager like npm or yarn installed. Then run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Run the application**:

    To run the application on an emulator or a connected device, execute:

    ```bash
    npm run android
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    npm run ios
    ```

    The command for iOS requires you to have Xcode installed and a properly configured development environment for iOS.

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
